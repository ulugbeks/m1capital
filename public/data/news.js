Energy Park has today announced its certification as a B Corporation (B Corp), joining a growing global community of businesses working to create a more inclusive, equitable and regenerative economy. The certification confirms Energy Park’s commitment to using business as a force for good and prioritising purpose as well as profit to ensure its actions impact positively on all stakeholders, including workers, communities, customers and our planet.

Energy Park has been certified by B Lab, the not-for-profit behind the B Corp movement, as having met rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. The B Impact Assessment evaluated Energy Park’s practices and outputs across five key areas of Governance, Workers, Community, Environment and Customers. The company's Impact Score exceeded B Corp’s 80-point threshold for certification, performing particularly well in the areas of environmental footprint and employee wellbeing.

To complete certification, Energy Park was required to legally embed its commitment to purpose as well as profit in its company articles.

Energy Park Founder and COO, Gavin Malone, says: “We’re delighted to be B Corp certified, particularly so early on in our company’s growth. From day one, we’ve been committed to building a business where our people and the planet are just as important as profit, so this certification is a significant milestone for us.

“As a purpose-driven company, we’re focused on creating fairer access to more affordable EV charging for residents of apartment buildings, who are typically underserved and often have to accept inequitable solutions. We want to uplift people’s lives with our EV charging solutions, while impacting positively on the world around us, so our goals feel strongly aligned with the aims of the B Corp movement.

“But the work doesn’t stop here. Certification is just the beginning of a journey of continuous improvement, and we’ll continue to work towards a more equitable and sustainable future.”

Chris Turner, Executive Director of B Lab UK, says: “We are delighted to welcome Energy Park to the B Corp community. This is a movement of companies that are committed to changing how business operates and believe business really can be a force for good. We know that Energy Park is going to be a fantastic addition to the community and will continue driving the conversation forward.”

Energy Park is now part of a growing community of over 9,700 businesses globally that have certified as B Corps.
